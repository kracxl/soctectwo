    <div id="what1">To make it simple, a computer is something used for computing! Who would have guessed? Computers can be as simple as a house calculator, or a super high-tech supercomputer, such used by astronauts! The most usual computers we see are the ones we use at home. They can also hold or store information, which might look like regular language to us, but are actually just a bunch of 1’s and 0’s! How cool is that?</div>

    <div id="pb">What are the purpose and benefits</div>
    <div id="pb1">Computers can do all sorts of stuff! The most common thing it’s used for today is to browse the internet to either communicate with people, or search the web to do research! The computer has slated itself as a necessity in everyday modern life. 
    Computers are used to do what a lot of normal people can’t!</div>

Thinking like a Computer

Have you ever wondered why computers speak binary? 
With all these 1's and 0's, it is really confusing to people.
But to computers, it seems very easy. Why?
Well, to computers, 1's and 0's is easy to understand because they only understand two states. 
A state with electricity, and another without electricity.

But doesn't this mean that the computer is limited to think in these two states?
Well if we add another digit called a bit we can now have 4 states, namely: 00, 01, 10, 11.
And this can expand infinitely and programmers gave these states meaning so that we can recreate our language in the computer.
