Computers can be as simple as a house calculator, or a super high-tech supercomputer, such used by astronauts! The most usual computers we see are the ones we use at home. They can also hold or store information, which might look like regular language to us, but are actually just a bunch of 1’s and 0’s! How cool is that?</div>
